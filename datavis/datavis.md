# Data Visualization

In *Please Solve's* [Statistics](/statistics) course, wherever possible, the exercise problems are explained through visualizations using the following tools:

* [_matplotlib_](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [_ggplot2_](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
* [_plotly_](https://plotly.com/python/)

The problems provided here are basic in nature and the data can be obtained from the exercise questions. Complexity of data or the problem will not stand in the way of understanding and comparing of plotting procedures in these tools. 

_matplotlib_ and _ggplot2_ are integrated with many libraries of Python and R, respectively. _Plotly_ is integrated with both _matplotlib_ and _ggplot2_ and useful in deploying figures in applications using _Dash_, which is a framework for building web applications.
