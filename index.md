Learn While Solving

Welcome to **Please Solve**!

Learning online involves isolating oneself from social interactions with fellow students that can be demotivating, boring and easily distracting. In such a setting, _Please Solve_ is an attempt to keep learners engaged by introducing them to questions and problems and as we do so, hopefully, definitions and concepts can be picked up.This can help in building a quick familiarity over a topic with confidence.
