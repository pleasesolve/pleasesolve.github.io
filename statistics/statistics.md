# Statistics

Statistics has become increasingly important as we try to learn about our complex environment using data. Aimed at quick learning online, in this course, we will take a look at basic concepts of statistics while solving exercise problems from the book: "Teach yourself Statistics" by Richard Goodman.

The book is avilable for free online [here](https://archive.org/details/TeachYourselfStatistics).
