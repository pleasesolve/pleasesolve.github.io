# Python and R

Python and R are popular open source programming tools for data analysis. For those who start out data analysis, a puzzling question in the back of their minds is which language to use for data analysis and machine learning, Python or R? There is no simple answer to this question. Because one language isn't better than the other it depends on available tools and applications. 

To make it simpler, here at Please Solve, both Python and R implementations are presented for basic problems of statistics. Hopefully, they can be helpful to understand the nuances of both the language and to make smart choice for a data scenario at hand. 

A list of implementations is provided below. There is also a [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWYDYtNLvURwSDzofvJ94qGGoboRf96w9){:target="_blank"} available.
